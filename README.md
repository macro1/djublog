[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macro1/djublog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macro1/djublog)

This Django app will allow your Django project to become a Microblog,
an open standard for twitter-like posting over a distributed network.

It's currently still under development, I'm making the code available
early in order to collaborate with @Sonictherocketman on his standard
while developing.
